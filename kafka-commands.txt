1) Create VM in Microsoft Azure and download the private key

2) Open VM resource and Navigate to Connect >> Native SSH >> Select

3) Copy our VM's public IP
   
   Public IP : 40.90.249.251

4) Also go to 3rd Step in Native SSH and provide private key's directory in the prompt box. We will get a ssh command as follows:

   ssh -i vmkeyforkafka.pem azureuser@40.90.249.251

   We will use this command to connect to our VM from local terminal using private key

5) open the command and run the ssh command copied in earlier step. This will open our VM

6) Download kafka file using following command from our terminal

   wget https://downloads.apache.org/kafka/3.5.1/kafka_2.12-3.5.1.tgz

7) Unzip the downloaded file using following command

   tar -xvf kafka_2.12-3.5.1.tgz

8) Before we can run kafka we have to install java on our VM. So use following commands to install java

   for ubuntu manchine:

   sudo apt-get update

   sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk

9) Now we can change the directory to kafka folder to run commands

   cd kafka_2.12-3.5.1

10) To run our zookeeper we will use the following command:

    bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties

11) To run the kafka server we need to open a new terminal, so we will open a new terminal and run step no. 4

12) Before navigating to kafka folder we will run following command to increase memory of our kafka

    export KAFKA_HEAP_OPTS="-Xmx256M -Xms128M"

13) Now we will do step no. 9 and run the kafka server using following command

    cd kafka_2.12-3.5.1

    bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties

14) Now our kafka server is running, but it is running on private IP. To access the server we need to change it to public.
    For this we will close our zookeeper and kafka server, open our VM, navigate to kafka folder (step 4 and 9) and use the following command.
    
    sudo nano config/server.properties

    This will open our properties page, where we need to change the ADVERTISED_LISTENERS settings.
    For this go to line "#advertised.listeners=PLAINTEXT://your.host.name:9092"
    
    Edit it to "advertised.listeners=PLAINTEXT://40.90.249.251:9092"

    Here you have to remove the comment and add your public IP in place of your.local.host

    To save changes click on : "Ctrl+X" then "y" and "Enter"

15) Before we can run our servers again we need to give permission to the port 9092, which is used by kafka, to our VM.
    
    For this navigate to VM resource page >> Networking >> Add inbount port rule

    Here you have to select Source and Destination as per usage. Add value 9092 to Destination port range and then click on Add.

16) Now we can start using kafka. First run the zookeeper in one terminal using step 4, 9 and 10

    In another terminal run kafka server using step 4 and 13

17) To create a new topic open a new terminal and repete step 4 and 9, and then use the following command.
    Change the IP address, topic name, num of partitions and replication as per requirement. 

    bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --topic topic_name --bootstrap-server 40.90.249.251:9092 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1
    
18) Once the topic is created, Start our producer using the following command (you can use the same terminal)
    Edit the topic name and IP address as per your system specs

    bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --topic topic_name --bootstrap-server 40.90.249.251:9092

19) We can now start our consumer in a new terminal again. Open a new terminal and repete step 4 and 9.
    Use the following command to start consumer.
    Edit the topic name and IP address as per your system specs

    bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --topic topic_name --bootstrap-server 40.90.249.251:9092

20) Now we can write our messages to producer and we can see the messages on the consumer live.
